# Data-Analytics-Part-2
Week nine learns about Data Analytics such as data analysis, data visualization, and communication.

### What is Data Analysis?
Data analysis is a research analysis activity carried out by examining all forms of data from research components, such as notes, documents, test results, recordings, oral history and so on. Another definition is a method for processing or processing data into valid information that is easy to understand when presented to the general public and then used to find solutions to problems.

### What is Statistics?
Statistics are a set of number and non-number data arranged in a table or diagram. This illustrates that data is the raw information from which statistics are made. Statistics are the result of data analysis, interpretation, and presentation.

### Opportunities 
Probability is a value (quantity) to express how likely an event is to occur. The probability of an event is the ratio between the number of events (n(A)) and all possible events (n(S)).
- Example :

### What is Data Visualization?
Data Visualization is the graphic representation of data. It converts a huge dataset into small graphs, thus aiding in data analysis and predictions. It makes data complex and easier to understand and access. Matplotlib and Seaborn act as the backbone of data visualization through Python.

### Matplotlib
Matplotlib is the most popular python library for doing data visualization that is more interesting and easy to understand so matplotlib will feel more natural to learn. Matplotlib has many examples of charts that can be used to visualize data to make it more interesting. One of them, Line Chart, is used to display information using many points that are connected to each other and form a straight or curved line.

### Seaborn
Seaborn is a library for creating graphs and statistics using Python. This library builds on the existing Matplotlib library. It is then integrated with the data structures in Pandas. Seaborn is much more functional and organized. It treats the entire dataset as a single entity.
- Examples of some Seaborn Styles in Line Chart form :
